Attic => PHP wiki + git
=======================

Attic is a fork of the fantasticly simple [Textloft][textloft] with git versioning support.
Description from the Textloft README:

> Sometimes all you need is a place to put your text.
>
> (Yet another) Dead-simple PHP wiki. Responsive layout, LESS, Markdown, iOS web-app capable and HTML5 rolled into a tiny little package.
>
> Basically, I really liked [gollum](https://github.com/github/gollum/) but wanted something I could drop in any old folder on any old Apache server and have an instant wiki.
